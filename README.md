# Overview

Impliment programs based around reading in a file and using it's inputs against other files to compare lines

This program uses 3 files: questions, responses, and key. It promps the user to respond to questions
saves the repsonse in the responses file, then compares the responses to the key file, displaying a
grade for the attempt.

The purpose of this software is to be able to administer practice tests based on simple files.
